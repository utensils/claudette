# Technical Design: Remote Terminal via WebSocket

**Status**: Draft
**Date**: 2026-04-07
**Issue**: [#79](https://github.com/utensils/Claudette/issues/79) (Option 4)

## 1. Overview

Add remote terminal access so that opening a terminal on a remote workspace spawns a PTY on the remote `claudette-server` and streams I/O over the existing WebSocket connection to the local xterm.js instance. The user experience should be identical to a local terminal — the only visual distinction is a label indicating the terminal is remote.

## 2. Current Architecture

### Local Terminal Flow

```
User opens terminal tab
  → TerminalPanel calls spawnPty(worktreePath) → Tauri command
  → Rust spawns PTY via portable_pty, starts background reader thread
  → Reader emits Tauri "pty-output" events with { pty_id, data: [u8] }
  → Frontend listens on "pty-output", writes to xterm.js
  → User types → term.onData() → writePty(ptyId, bytes) → Tauri command
  → Rust writes to PTY master
```

### Key Files

| Component | File | Role |
|-----------|------|------|
| Frontend component | `src/ui/src/components/terminal/TerminalPanel.tsx` | xterm.js lifecycle, tab management |
| Frontend services | `src/ui/src/services/tauri.ts` | `spawnPty`, `writePty`, `resizePty`, `closePty` wrappers |
| Frontend store | `src/ui/src/stores/useAppStore.ts` | Terminal tabs, active tab, panel visibility |
| Tauri PTY backend | `src-tauri/src/pty.rs` | PTY spawn, read loop, write, resize, close |
| Tauri state | `src-tauri/src/state.rs` | `PtyHandle`, `AppState.ptys` HashMap |
| Server handler | `src-server/src/handler.rs` | `spawn_pty`, `write_pty`, `resize_pty`, `close_pty` RPC handlers |
| Server state | `src-server/src/ws.rs` | `ServerState.ptys` HashMap, `PtyHandle` |

### Server-Side PTY (Already Implemented)

The `claudette-server` already supports PTY operations over its JSON-RPC protocol:

| Method | Params | Returns | Events |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| `spawn_pty` | `workspace_id`, `cwd`, `rows`, `cols` | `{ pty_id }` | Streams `pty-output` events with `{ pty_id, data }` |
| `write_pty` | `pty_id`, `data` (byte array) | `null` | — |
| `resize_pty` | `pty_id`, `rows`, `cols` | `null` | — |
| `close_pty` | `pty_id` | `null` | — |

Server PTY output is sent as WebSocket events:
```json
{ "event": "pty-output", "payload": { "pty_id": 1, "data": [72, 101, 108, 108, 111] } }
```

These events are already forwarded to the Tauri event bus by `RemoteConnectionManager::add()` under their original event name (`pty-output`), so the existing `TerminalPanel` event listener will receive them.

### Gap Analysis

The server-side PTY infrastructure is complete. The gap is entirely on the client side:

1. `TerminalPanel` always calls local Tauri commands (`spawn_pty`, `write_pty`, etc.) — no remote routing
2. No way to distinguish local vs remote PTY IDs (both are `u64` counters starting at 1, so they can collide)
3. Terminal tab creation always goes through the local database, which has a FK constraint against `workspaces(id)` — remote workspaces are not in the local DB
4. `WorkspaceActions` "Open in Terminal" doesn't work for remote workspaces
5. Local `spawn_pty` Tauri command hard-codes PTY size to 24x80 and does not accept `rows`/`cols` — the server-side version does accept them. This mismatch is acceptable: the local flow relies on an immediate `resize_pty` call after spawn (triggered by `FitAddon.fit()`), and the same pattern will work for remote. No change needed to the local command for this feature.

## 3. Design

### 3.1 PTY ID Namespacing

Local and remote PTY IDs can collide (both use independent atomic counters). To distinguish them, the frontend will use a composite key:

```typescript
type PtyKey = {
  ptyId: number;
  connectionId: string | null; // null = local
};
```

The `pty-output` event listener already receives events from both local Tauri emissions and remote WebSocket forwarding on the same `"pty-output"` channel. To route output to the correct terminal instance, each `TermInstance` stores its `PtyKey` and the listener matches on both `pty_id` and source.

**Event disambiguation**: Remote `pty-output` events arrive via `RemoteConnectionManager` event forwarding, which emits them as Tauri events under the same `"pty-output"` name. Since both local and remote events hit the same listener, we need to add `connection_id` to the payload so the frontend can match events to the correct terminal instance.

### 3.2 Remote PTY Command Routing

Instead of branching in every call site, introduce a thin routing layer in the service module:

```typescript
// spawnRemotePty must unwrap and validate the server response,
// which returns { pty_id: number } rather than a bare number.
export async function spawnRemotePty(
  connectionId: string,
  workspaceId: string,
  cwd: string,
  rows: number,
  cols: number,
): Promise<number> {
  const result = await sendRemoteCommand(connectionId, "spawn_pty", {
    workspace_id: workspaceId, cwd, rows, cols,
  });
  if (result === null || typeof result !== "object" || !("pty_id" in result)) {
    throw new Error("Invalid spawn_pty response: expected { pty_id: number }");
  }
  return (result as { pty_id: number }).pty_id;
}

export function writeRemotePty(
  connectionId: string,
  ptyId: number,
  data: number[],
): Promise<void>

export function resizeRemotePty(
  connectionId: string,
  ptyId: number,
  rows: number,
  cols: number,
): Promise<void>

export function closeRemotePty(
  connectionId: string,
  ptyId: number,
): Promise<void>
```

These call `sendRemoteCommand()` with the appropriate method and params. The existing local `spawnPty`/`writePty`/`resizePty`/`closePty` functions remain unchanged.

### 3.3 TerminalPanel Changes

`TerminalPanel` needs to know whether the current workspace is remote so it can route PTY operations. The component already has access to the workspace via the store.

**Instance tracking** — extend the `TermInstance` type:

```typescript
interface TermInstance {
  term: Terminal;
  fit: FitAddon;
  ptyId: number;
  connectionId: string | null; // NEW — null for local
  unlisten: () => void;
  container: HTMLDivElement;
  resizeObserver: ResizeObserver;
}
```

**Spawn flow change**:

```
if workspace.remote_connection_id:
  ptyId = await spawnRemotePty(connectionId, wsId, worktreePath, rows, cols)
  // Listen for "pty-output" events, filter by pty_id AND connection_id
else:
  ptyId = await spawnPty(worktreePath)
  // Listen for "pty-output" events, filter by pty_id only (connection_id absent)
```

**Write/resize/close** — check `instance.connectionId` to decide routing:

```
if instance.connectionId:
  writeRemotePty(connectionId, ptyId, data)
else:
  writePty(ptyId, data)
```

### 3.4 Event Forwarding Enhancement

Currently `RemoteConnectionManager::add()` forwards all remote events with their original name and payload:

```rust
let _ = app.emit(&event.event, &event.payload);
```

For `pty-output` events, the payload from the server is `{ pty_id, data }`. The frontend needs to know which remote connection the event came from to avoid PTY ID collisions. Two options:

**Option A — Annotate in Rust**: Modify the event forwarding to inject `connection_id` into `pty-output` payloads before emitting.

**Option B — Separate event name**: Emit remote PTY events as `"remote-pty-output"` with `{ connection_id, pty_id, data }`.

**Chosen: Option A** — keeps a single listener and is consistent with how `agent-stream` events already work (workspace_id in the payload disambiguates). The change is small and localized to `RemoteConnectionManager::add()`.

```rust
// In the event forwarding task:
while let Ok(event) = event_rx.recv().await {
    if event.event == "pty-output" {
        // Inject connection_id so frontend can disambiguate
        let mut payload = event.payload.clone();
        if let Some(obj) = payload.as_object_mut() {
            obj.insert("connection_id".to_string(),
                serde_json::Value::String(connection_id.clone()));
        }
        let _ = app.emit("pty-output", &payload);
    } else {
        let _ = app.emit(&event.event, &event.payload);
    }
}
```

### 3.5 Terminal Tab Creation for Remote Workspaces

Local terminal tabs are persisted in the local SQLite database via `create_terminal_tab`. The `terminal_tabs` table has a foreign key on `workspace_id` referencing `workspaces(id)` with `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`. Remote workspaces are never inserted into the local `workspaces` table (they exist only in the frontend Zustand store), so calling `create_terminal_tab` with a remote workspace ID would violate the FK constraint.

Therefore:

- **Local workspace terminal tabs** continue to use the existing SQLite-backed `create_terminal_tab` / `list_terminal_tabs` flow.
- **Remote workspace terminal tabs** are ephemeral client-side state managed purely in the Zustand store. They must not call the DB-backed terminal tab APIs.
- The tab still carries the remote `workspace_id` in frontend state so the UI can group, focus, and route PTY traffic correctly.
- On app restart, local terminal tabs are restored from SQLite as they are today; remote terminal tabs are not restored (reconnecting to the server provides a fresh state).

Implementation: `TerminalPanel` checks `workspace.remote_connection_id` before calling `createTerminalTab` / `listTerminalTabs`. For remote workspaces, it generates a tab ID locally (e.g., `Date.now()`) and adds it directly to the Zustand store.

### 3.6 WorkspaceActions Integration

`WorkspaceActions` currently has two actions, both of which need remote-aware behavior:

**"Open in Terminal"** — Currently calls `openWorkspaceInTerminal(worktreePath)`, which opens an **external** terminal application (e.g., Alacritty, Kitty) at the local worktree path. This fundamentally cannot work for remote workspaces since the path doesn't exist on the local machine.

For remote workspaces, the "open-terminal" action should show a modal explaining the situation and offering two choices:

> **Remote Terminal**
>
> Remote terminals can only be opened in app. Alternatively you can SSH into the remote per usual.
>
> [ Open in App ]  [ Copy Remote Path ]

- **Open in App** — Opens the built-in terminal pane and creates a remote terminal tab with a PTY on the server.
- **Copy Remote Path** — Copies the remote worktree path to clipboard so the user can `ssh` and `cd` manually.

For local workspaces, behavior is unchanged (opens external terminal directly, no modal).

Implementation:

1. `WorkspaceActions` needs access to `remote_connection_id` (passed as a prop or read from the store)
2. When `remote_connection_id` is set, the "open-terminal" action opens the `RemoteTerminalModal` instead of calling `openWorkspaceInTerminal`
3. The modal's "Open in App" button toggles the built-in terminal panel visible and creates a new remote terminal tab
4. The modal's "Copy Remote Path" button copies `worktreePath` to clipboard and closes the modal

**"Copy Path"** — For local workspaces, behavior is unchanged. For remote workspaces, label changes to "Copy Remote Path" to clarify context.

`WorkspaceActions` props need to be extended:

```typescript
interface WorkspaceActionsProps {
  worktreePath: string | null;
  remoteConnectionId: string | null; // NEW
  disabled?: boolean;
}
```

`ChatPanel` already has access to `ws.remote_connection_id` and passes it through.

### 3.7 Visual Distinction

Remote terminal tabs should be visually distinguishable. Add a subtle indicator (e.g., a globe icon or "remote" label) to the tab title when the terminal is connected to a remote workspace. This reuses the same pattern as the dashboard remote badge.

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1 Backend: Annotate remote pty-output events

**File**: `src-tauri/src/remote.rs`

In the event forwarding task within `RemoteConnectionManager::add()`, inject `connection_id` into `pty-output` event payloads before emitting to the Tauri event bus.

### 4.2 Frontend: Remote PTY service functions

**File**: `src/ui/src/services/tauri.ts`

Add four new functions that route PTY commands to a remote server via `sendRemoteCommand`:

- `spawnRemotePty(connectionId, workspaceId, cwd, rows, cols)` → calls `spawn_pty`
- `writeRemotePty(connectionId, ptyId, data)` → calls `write_pty`
- `resizeRemotePty(connectionId, ptyId, rows, cols)` → calls `resize_pty`
- `closeRemotePty(connectionId, ptyId)` → calls `close_pty`

### 4.3 Frontend: TerminalPanel remote routing

**File**: `src/ui/src/components/terminal/TerminalPanel.tsx`

1. Read `workspace.remote_connection_id` from the store
2. Extend `TermInstance` with `connectionId: string | null`
3. On tab creation: skip `createTerminalTab` DB call for remote workspaces; generate a local tab ID and add directly to Zustand store
4. On spawn: route to `spawnRemotePty` or `spawnPty` based on `remote_connection_id`
5. On `pty-output` listener: match events by both `pty_id` and `connection_id` (local events have no `connection_id` field)
6. On write/resize/close: check `instance.connectionId` to choose local or remote function
7. On cleanup: call correct close function based on `connectionId`

### 4.4 Frontend: WorkspaceActions + RemoteTerminalModal

**Files**: `src/ui/src/components/chat/WorkspaceActions.tsx`, `src/ui/src/components/chat/ChatPanel.tsx`, `src/ui/src/components/modals/RemoteTerminalModal.tsx` (new)

1. Add `remoteConnectionId` prop to `WorkspaceActionsProps`
2. Pass `ws.remote_connection_id` from `ChatPanel` to `WorkspaceActions`
3. "Open in Terminal" action: when `remoteConnectionId` is set, open `RemoteTerminalModal` instead of calling `openWorkspaceInTerminal`
4. `RemoteTerminalModal` displays explanatory text and two buttons:
   - "Open in App" — toggles built-in terminal panel visible, creates a remote terminal tab, closes modal
   - "Copy Remote Path" — copies `worktreePath` to clipboard, closes modal
5. "Copy Path" action: when `remoteConnectionId` is set, relabel to "Copy Remote Path"

### 4.5 Frontend: Remote tab indicator

**File**: `src/ui/src/components/terminal/TerminalPanel.tsx`

When rendering tab titles, check if the workspace is remote and prepend a globe icon or "(remote)" suffix to distinguish from local terminals.

## 5. Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src-tauri/src/remote.rs` | Inject `connection_id` into `pty-output` event payloads |
| `src/ui/src/services/tauri.ts` | Add `spawnRemotePty`, `writeRemotePty`, `resizeRemotePty`, `closeRemotePty` |
| `src/ui/src/components/terminal/TerminalPanel.tsx` | Remote routing in spawn/write/resize/close, event disambiguation, ephemeral tab creation for remote workspaces, tab label |
| `src/ui/src/components/chat/WorkspaceActions.tsx` | Add `remoteConnectionId` prop, show modal for remote "Open in Terminal", relabel "Copy Path" |
| `src/ui/src/components/chat/ChatPanel.tsx` | Pass `ws.remote_connection_id` to `WorkspaceActions` |
| `src/ui/src/components/modals/RemoteTerminalModal.tsx` | **New** — modal with "Open in App" and "Copy Remote Path" options |

## 6. Testing

### Manual verification

- Open a terminal on a local workspace — behavior unchanged
- Connect to a remote server, open a remote workspace
- Open terminal on remote workspace — PTY spawns on server, output streams to local xterm.js
- Type commands in remote terminal — input reaches server PTY
- Resize terminal panel — remote PTY receives resize
- Close remote terminal tab — server PTY is cleaned up
- Open multiple terminals (mix of local and remote) — output routes to correct instances
- Disconnect from remote server — remote terminal tabs show disconnected state or close gracefully
- Tab label shows remote indicator for remote terminals

### Edge cases

- Rapid typing in remote terminal (latency tolerance)
- Large output bursts (e.g., `cat` a large file) — verify no data loss
- Remote server goes down while terminal is open — verify graceful degradation
- Multiple remote connections with terminals open simultaneously
- PTY ID collision between local and remote (same numeric ID) — verify disambiguation works

## 7. Future Considerations

- **Terminal session persistence**: Save/restore terminal scrollback across reconnections
- **Per-connection PTY limits**: Server-side enforcement of max PTYs per client
- **Latency indicator**: Show round-trip time in terminal tab for remote connections
- **Connection-scoped cleanup**: Server already cleans up PTYs when WebSocket closes; verify this works correctly
