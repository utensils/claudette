# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

# Claudette

Cross-platform desktop orchestrator for parallel Claude Code agents, built with Rust (Tauri 2) and React/TypeScript.

## AI assistant configuration

This file is the source of truth for project conventions. Several companion configs read by other AI tools live alongside it and need to stay aligned when the rules here change:

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — repo-wide guidance read by GitHub Copilot on every PR review and code suggestion.
- `.github/instructions/rust.instructions.md` — scoped to `**/*.rs` via `applyTo` frontmatter.
- `.github/instructions/frontend.instructions.md` — scoped to `src/ui/**/*.{ts,tsx,css}`.
- `.github/instructions/regression-review.instructions.md` — scoped to all files; used during PR review for regression-first checking.
- `AGENTS.md` — symlink to this CLAUDE.md, read by Codex / OpenCode / other agent tools that look for that filename. **Edit CLAUDE.md, never AGENTS.md.**

When you change architecture, commands, code-style, regression rules, or god-file lists in this CLAUDE.md, scan the Copilot files for the same statement and update both. Drift here causes Copilot's PR reviews to flag (or miss) issues that don't match what we tell humans.

## Build & test commands

```bash
# Backend (Rust)
cargo test --all-features                        # Run all backend tests
cargo test -p claudette --test diff_tests        # Run a single test file
cargo test -p claudette parse_unified -- --exact # Run a single test by name
cargo clippy -p claudette -p claudette-server -p claudette-cli --all-targets --all-features  # Lint (CI command — must pass with zero warnings)
cargo fmt --all --check                          # Check formatting

# Frontend (React/TypeScript)
cd src/ui && bun install                         # Install frontend dependencies
cd src/ui && bun run build                       # Build frontend (runs tsc -b && vite build)
cd src/ui && bunx tsc -b                         # TypeScript type check (same as CI)
cd src/ui && bun run test                        # Run frontend tests (vitest)
cd src/ui && bun run test:watch                  # Run tests in watch mode
cd src/ui && bun run lint                        # ESLint check
cd src/ui && bun run lint:css                    # CSS design-token enforcement (also runs in CI)

# Full app
cargo tauri dev                                  # Dev mode with hot-reload
cargo tauri build                                # Release build
```

IMPORTANT: CI sets `RUSTFLAGS="-Dwarnings"` — all compiler warnings are errors. Fix warnings before committing.

IMPORTANT: Always run `cd src/ui && bunx tsc -b` after modifying TypeScript files (including tests). CI runs `tsc -b` via `bun run build` — `vitest` does **not** type-check (it uses esbuild), so tests can pass locally while types are broken. Run `tsc -b` as the final check before committing any frontend change.

CI also enforces `bun install --frozen-lockfile` — do not modify `bun.lock` without intention. CI runs `cargo llvm-cov` for Rust test coverage (uploaded to Codecov, informational/non-blocking). CI clippy lints `claudette`, `claudette-server`, and `claudette-cli` (not `claudette-tauri`, which requires system libs that aren't installed on the lint runner). Frontend CI runs `bunx tsc --noEmit` as a dedicated type-check step before `bun run build`.

## Code style

- Rust edition 2024 — use modern idioms (`let chains`, `gen blocks` if stabilized, etc.)
- Default `rustfmt` and `clippy` rules — no custom overrides
- Prefer `cargo fmt` before committing; CI enforces it
- TypeScript: strict mode, no `any` types

## Commit conventions

- **Conventional commits required** — `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `ci:`, `chore:`, etc.
- Header max 100 characters
- PR titles must also follow conventional commit format (validated by CI)
- Release management is automated via release-please

## Architecture

- **GUI**: Tauri 2.x (Rust backend) + React/TypeScript (webview frontend)
- **State management**: Zustand (single store with domain slices)
- **Async runtime**: Tokio for process management and git operations
- **Data persistence**: SQLite via rusqlite (bundled)
- **Git operations**: Shelling out to `git` via `tokio::process::Command` for worktree ops
- **Agent integration**: Claude CLI subprocess with JSON streaming, bridged to frontend via Tauri events
- **Terminal emulation**: portable-pty (Rust) + xterm.js (frontend)
- **IPC**: Tauri commands (`#[tauri::command]`) for request/response, Tauri events for streaming

### Crate structure

Four crates in a Cargo workspace:

| Crate | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `claudette` | `src/` (workspace root) | Core library — models, db, git, diff, agent logic. No UI or Tauri dependencies. |
| `claudette-tauri` | `src-tauri/` | Tauri binary (`claudette-app`). Thin `#[tauri::command]` wrappers that call into `claudette`. |
| `claudette-server` | `src-server/` | WebSocket server for remote access. Also embeddable in the Tauri binary. |
| `claudette-cli` | `src-cli/` | Command-line client (`claudette` binary) that drives the running GUI over a local IPC socket. |

Feature flags in `claudette-tauri`:
- `default = ["server", "voice", "devtools"]`
- `voice` — pulls in `cpal` (audio capture), `candle-*` (Whisper inference), `tokenizers`, `rubato`, `hound`. Linux requires `libasound2-dev` (ALSA); headless builds drop it via `--no-default-features --features tauri/custom-protocol,server`.
- `devtools` — enables Tauri devtools (`tauri/devtools`)
- `server` — optional dep on `claudette-server`

### Frontend

- Vite dev server port is chosen by `scripts/dev.sh` (default base **14253**, probes for the first free port and exports `VITE_PORT`); `strictPort: true` so a probe/Vite race fails loudly. Default was moved off Tauri's stock 1420 because other Tauri starter templates default to it and their dev scripts can rebind the port underneath a running webview.
- TypeScript enforces `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`
- Test runner is **vitest** (not Jest)
- macOS uses overlay title bar (`titleBarStyle: "Overlay"`) — affects layout near top of window

### Tauri commands

Commands in `src-tauri/src/commands/` are organized by domain: `apps`, `auth`, `cesp`, `chat`, `cli`, `community`, `data`, `debug`, `devtools`, `diff`, `env`, `files`, `grammars`, `mcp`, `metrics`, `pinned_prompts`, `plan`, `plugin`, `plugins_runtime`, `remote`, `repository`, `scm`, `settings`, `shell`, `slash_commands`, `terminal`, `updater`, `usage`, `voice`, `workspace`. Each is a thin wrapper — business logic belongs in the `claudette` crate.

### CLI client

`claudette` (in `src-cli/`) drives the running GUI over a local IPC socket (Unix domain socket on macOS/Linux, Named Pipes on Windows; `interprocess` crate). It reuses the same command core as the GUI, so tray, notifications, and workspace list update live. Subcommands include `capabilities`, `repo list`, `workspace create`, `chat send|show|turns|stop|answer|approve-plan|deny-plan`, and `batch validate|run`. IPC server lives in `src-tauri/src/ipc.rs`; CLI surface in `src-tauri/src/commands/cli.rs`. The CLI requires the GUI to be running — prefer it over poking the SQLite DB directly.

```

### Plugin system

A single sandboxed Lua runtime (`src/plugin_runtime/`) serves multiple plugin kinds declared via `plugin.json`'s `kind` field (`scm` | `env-provider`, defaults to `scm`). Each kind has its own domain consumer (`src/scm/`, `src/env_provider/`) that dispatches operations on top of the shared runtime. Bundled plugins live in `plugins/*/` and are seeded into the user's plugin dir on first run. Users can drop their own plugins into `~/.claudette/plugins/<name>/` (one `plugin.json` + one `init.lua`); discovery picks them up at startup.

**Plugin settings** (`manifest.settings: Vec<PluginSettingField>`) let a plugin declare typed user-configurable fields (boolean/text/select) that the Plugins settings section renders as a form. Values persist in `app_settings` as `plugin:{name}:setting:{key}` and are piped into the Lua `host.config("<key>")` surface at invocation time. Manifest defaults apply when no override is set. Global on/off state persists as `plugin:{name}:enabled = "false"` (absent key = enabled).

**Settings UI** separates two plugin concepts:
- **Plugins** (`src/ui/src/components/settings/sections/PluginsSettings.tsx`) — Claudette's own Lua plugins (SCM + env-provider). Always visible. Shows status, per-plugin toggle, and the manifest-declared settings form.
- **Claude Code Plugins** (`ClaudeCodePluginsSettings.tsx`, route key `claude-code-plugins`) — the Claude CLI marketplace integration from `src/plugin.rs` (marketplaces, channels, install/uninstall). Gated behind the `pluginManagementEnabled` experimental flag.

### Guidelines for new code

- **Data types** go in `model/` — keep them free of UI and IO dependencies. All model types must derive `Serialize`.
- **Service/IO modules** (`db.rs`, `git.rs`, `diff.rs`, `agent.rs`) live at `src/` level in the `claudette` crate
- **Tauri commands** go in `src-tauri/src/commands/` — thin wrappers that call into `claudette`
- **React components** go in `src/ui/src/components/` — organized by feature area
- **State** lives in the Zustand store (`useAppStore`) — UI state in React, agent sessions in Rust-side `AppState`
- **Streaming data** (agent events, PTY output) flows via Tauri events, consumed by React hooks
- **Colors and styling** use CSS custom properties defined in `styles/theme.css` — all colors must be `var(--token-name)` references; raw hex/rgba literals anywhere outside `theme.css` fail `bun run lint:css` (CI-blocking). Allowed exceptions: `rgba(var(--*-rgb), <alpha>)` for alpha layering, `getPropertyValue(...) || "#..."` safety fallbacks in `theme.ts`, and `accentPreview` swatches in CommandPalette that mirror existing theme hex values.

### God files — keep diffs surgical

These files are already large enough that adding more responsibility makes them harder to reason about. When touching them, prefer extracting cohesive behavior into a focused helper / hook / slice / child component near the owning feature, then wire it through the existing entry point. The goal is to reduce or isolate complexity, not pile on another unrelated concern.

- **Rust**: `src/diff.rs`, `src/git.rs`, `src/plugin.rs`, `src/mcp.rs`, `src/mcp_supervisor.rs`, `src-tauri/src/ipc.rs`, `src-tauri/src/voice.rs`, anything in `src-tauri/src/commands/*` that's already a few hundred lines.
- **Frontend**: `src/ui/src/components/sidebar/Sidebar.tsx`, `src/ui/src/components/chat/ChatPanel.tsx`, `src/ui/src/components/chat/ChatInputArea.tsx`, `src/ui/src/components/terminal/TerminalPanel.tsx`, `src/ui/src/services/tauri.ts`, large CSS modules (e.g. `Settings.module.css`).

If a god file grew because the right home for the new behavior didn't exist yet, build that home first and land it as a separate (or stacked) commit before adding the new responsibility.

### Regression discipline

Treat regressions as the main risk before style or aesthetic concerns. Before changing behavior, identify the current contract: persisted DB fields, Tauri command payloads, CLI output, plugin manifests, settings keys, localized strings, terminal/session semantics, worktree behavior, and visible UI workflows. Do not remove, rename, or silently reinterpret any of these unless the task explicitly asks for that change.

If a behavior change is intentional, call it out plainly in the PR summary or review response and add or update tests that pin the new behavior. If it was incidental, preserve compatibility instead. Never fix a type / lint / test failure by deleting tests, removing UI controls, dropping state fields, weakening assertions, or broadening types — fix the underlying mismatch and keep existing user-visible capabilities intact.

### Testing patterns

- **Rust**: tests use `tempfile::tempdir()` to create ephemeral git repos — no fixtures or test databases. Async tests use `#[tokio::test]`. Test modules live at the bottom of each file (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests`).
- **TypeScript**: vitest with `describe`/`it`/`expect`. Zustand tests reset state via `useAppStore.setState()` in `beforeEach`. No test database — frontend tests are pure state/logic tests. When constructing fixtures for store state, always read the actual type definition (e.g., `TerminalTab` in `types/terminal.ts`) — do not guess field names. Look for existing `make*` helpers in adjacent test files before creating new fixtures.

### Dev launcher

- **Use `./scripts/dev.sh`** (not bare `cargo tauri dev`). It probes free Vite + debug-eval ports (bases `14253` / `19432`), writes a per-PID discovery file at `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/claudette-dev/<pid>.json` so `/claudette-debug` can find the right instance, stages the CLI sidecar via `scripts/stage-cli-sidecar.sh`, and on macOS adds `--runner scripts/macos-dev-app-runner.sh` so the build is wrapped in a signed `.app` bundle (using `src-tauri/Entitlements.plist`) — required for TCC to grant mic/speech permissions to Claudette rather than the terminal. Default features used: `devtools,server,voice` (override via `$CARGO_TAURI_FEATURES`).
- Bare `cargo tauri dev` still works for non-voice changes but **does not** invoke the macOS runner, probe ports, or write the discovery file.

### macOS privacy-prompt contract

Do not trigger CoreAudio or Speech.framework permission prompts at app launch — macOS attributes the TCC prompt to that moment, and an unmotivated launch-time prompt looks like spyware.
- Voice setup uses `PlatformSpeechEngine::availability()` (prompt-safe; reports `NeedsSpeechPermission` etc.) for status display, and `prepare()` (triggers the TCC prompt) only inside `start_recording_locked` — i.e. when the user actually clicks the mic. There is no startup prewarm; cpal device enumeration is also avoided at launch.
- mDNS discovery currently starts at app launch so the sidebar's Nearby list stays populated without extra UI. Changing that affects macOS Local Network prompt timing and should come with an intentional replacement UX.

### Windows specifics

- Windows builds use MSVC toolchain; `[target.'cfg(windows)'.dependencies]` in `Cargo.toml` pulls in Windows-only crates. Gate Windows-specific code with `#[cfg(windows)]` / `#[cfg(not(windows))]` rather than Unix-only paths.
- **Cross-compilation** (Nix devshell): `build-win-arm64` / `build-win-x64` via `cargo xwin` (requires `XWIN_ACCEPT_LICENSE=1`); `deploy-win-arm64` / `deploy-win-x64` build and push to the test VM.
- **Ephemeral Windows EC2** (Nix devshell): `aws-win-spinup` launches a Windows Server 2022 instance (state in `.claudette/aws-win/`, gitignored); `aws-win-rdp` opens RDP; `aws-win-destroy` terminates. Defaults: `AWS_PROFILE=dev.urandom.io`, `AWS_REGION=us-west-2`.
- CI/nightly/release builds Windows as bare `.exe` (no installer), zipped for distribution — `cargo xwin build --release --features tauri/custom-protocol`.

### Notification architecture

- Notification sound and commands run on the **Rust side** (not in the webview) — macOS suspends webview JS when the window is hidden
- `tray.rs` handles attention notifications (AskUserQuestion/ExitPlanMode); `commands/chat.rs` handles agent-finished notifications
- Both paths use the shared `build_notification_command` helper in `commands/settings.rs`
- `mac-notification-sys` for native macOS notifications with click-to-navigate; `tauri-plugin-notification` on Linux

### Database conventions

- `rusqlite::Connection` is not `Send` — open a fresh connection in each Tauri command via `Database::open(&state.db_path)`
- UI-only state (collapsed sections, panel widths, selection) is NOT persisted — keep in Zustand

### Schema migrations

- Migrations live as `.sql` files under `src/migrations/` and are registered in `src/migrations/mod.rs` as `Migration` entries in the `MIGRATIONS` const slice.
- **Adding a migration:** create `src/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_snake_case_description.sql` using the current UTC timestamp, then append a matching `Migration { id, sql: include_str!(...), legacy_version: None }` entry to `MIGRATIONS`. Migration IDs must be unique — a test enforces this.
- **Never edit the SQL of a released migration.** The `id` is the tracked identity; rewriting or renaming applied migrations will desync databases in the field. Fix forward with a new migration.
- **Merging branches:** each new migration is a distinct `.sql` file and a distinct `MIGRATIONS` entry, so parallel-branch migrations no longer collide on an integer version — both apply when merged. If two branches happen to choose the same timestamp (e.g. from `date -u +%Y%m%d%H%M%S` run at the same second), git will surface the clash as a merge conflict in `mod.rs`; bump one timestamp by a second and rename its file to resolve.
- `PRAGMA user_version` is retained only to seed `schema_migrations` once on pre-redesign databases during the first run of the new runner. Do not read or write it in new code.
- **"Already exists" leniency:** the runner treats `SQLITE_ERROR` failures whose message contains `"already exists"` or `"duplicate column name"` as benign — it logs `[migrations] <id> skipped: ...` to stderr, marks the migration applied, and continues. This makes hand-applied or out-of-order migrations on dev DBs survivable. It does **not** license writing migrations that depend on this: keep them strictly forward-only and additive, and prefer `IF NOT EXISTS` on new `CREATE TABLE` / `CREATE INDEX` statements.

## CI/CD pipeline

- **PR CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Rust fmt + clippy + tests (coverage → Codecov), TypeScript type-check + ESLint + `lint:css` + build + vitest.
- **Nightly** (`.github/workflows/nightly.yml`): Every push to `main` (excluding docs/README). Computes version as `<next-minor>-dev.<commit-count>.g<short-sha>`, stamps all three Cargo.toml files, builds macOS (arm64 + x86_64), Linux (x86_64 + aarch64), Windows (x86_64 + arm64), promotes atomically from `nightly-staging` to `nightly` tag.
- **Release** (`.github/workflows/release-please.yml`): Triggered by Conventional Commits via release-please. Auto-generates CHANGELOG, bumps workspace `Cargo.toml` (source of truth) + syncs `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` + `src-server/Cargo.toml`, builds all platforms, uploads assets, posts to Discord (`DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` secret).
- Windows builds in CI skip app bundling (bare `.exe`, zipped). macOS builds produce `.dmg`; Linux produces `.AppImage` + `.deb`.

## Debugging (dev builds only)

A debug TCP eval server runs on `127.0.0.1` in dev builds (default port `19432`, overridable via `$CLAUDETTE_DEBUG_PORT` — `scripts/dev.sh` probes for a free port so multiple dev instances can coexist). It executes JS in the webview and returns results over TCP. **Always use the `/claudette-debug` skill for debugging** — it auto-discovers the right instance via `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/claudette-dev/<pid>.json` and has recipes for state inspection, store tracing, session monitoring, and UAT.

```bash
/claudette-debug state                    # Store overview
/claudette-debug state completedTurns     # Dump a specific slice
/claudette-debug eval 'return 1+1'        # Arbitrary JS
/claudette-debug monitor start            # Background session monitor → /tmp/claudette-debug/monitor.log
/claudette-debug monitor read             # Tail monitor log
/claudette-debug snapshot                 # Full store dump
```

Helper scripts (use relative paths from project root):
- `.claude/skills/claudette-debug/scripts/debug-eval.sh` — single-shot JS eval
- `.claude/skills/claudette-debug/scripts/debug-monitor.sh` — long-running session monitor

Key globals exposed in dev mode:
- `window.__CLAUDETTE_STORE__` — Zustand store (`.getState()` / `.setState()`)
- `window.__CLAUDETTE_INVOKE__` — Tauri `invoke` function

All debug code is gated behind `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` / `import.meta.env.DEV` and excluded from release builds. See `.claude/skills/claudette-debug/SKILL.md` for full docs.

## Dependencies

- Add dependencies conservatively — binary size target is < 30 MB
- Cold start target is < 2 seconds to interactive UI
- When choosing crates, prefer well-maintained options with minimal transitive dependencies
- Frontend: use `bun` as package manager, not npm
